# AstroHUD
This is a Team Fortress 2 custom HUD modification, made to the specifications provided by Astroyed.

This HUD aims to deliver the following:
* Important information easily accessible and close to the middle of the screen
* HUD elements do not block the view. This is especially important for long range spy recon.
* Simplistic menus that do not contain rarely used features
* Aesthetically pleasing and modern
