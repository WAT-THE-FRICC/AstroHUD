RaysHUD-ifiyah instructions (with cringey raysfiyah name pun)

If you can't give up the L&F of raysHUD, here's what you need to do:

Uncomment (remove the two slashes // before)
the line defining the rayshud font
in AstroHUD/resource/ClientScheme_astrofonts.res
and comment out the Avenir font (add 2 slashes before)

Uncomment the RaysHUDtheme line in the same file.

You will overwrite the existing files there
and it is OK to do so.
